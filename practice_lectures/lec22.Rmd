# Using Probability Estimation to do Classification

First repeat quickly (a) load the adult data (b) do a training / test split and (c) build the logisitc model.

```{r}
pacman::p_load_gh("coatless/ucidata")
data(adult)
adult = na.omit(adult) #kill any observations with missingness

train_size = 5000
train_indices = sample(1 : nrow(adult), train_size)
adult_train = adult[train_indices, ]
y_train = adult_train$income
X_train = adult_train
X_train$income = NULL

test_size = 5000
test_indices = sample(setdiff(1 : nrow(adult), train_indices), test_size)
adult_test = adult[test_indices, ]
y_test = adult_test$income
X_test = adult_test
X_test$income = NULL

logistic_mod = glm(income ~ ., adult_train, family = "binomial")
p_hats_train = predict(logistic_mod, adult_train, type = "response")
p_hats_test = predict(logistic_mod, adult_test, type = "response")
```

Let's establish a rule: if the probability estimate is greater than or equal to 50%, let's classify the observation as positive, otherwise 0.

```{r}
y_hats_train = factor(ifelse(p_hats_train >= 0.5, ">50K", "<=50K"))
```

How did this "classifier" do in-sample?

```{r}
mean(y_hats_train != y_train)
table(y_train, y_hats_train)
```

Let's see the same thing oos:

```{r}
y_hats_test = factor(ifelse(p_hats_test >= 0.5, ">50K", "<=50K"))
mean(y_hats_test != y_test)
oos_conf_table = table(y_test, y_hats_test)
oos_conf_table
```

A tad bit worse. Here are estimates of the future performance for each class:

```{r}
n = sum(oos_conf_table)
fp = oos_conf_table[1, 2]
fn = oos_conf_table[2, 1]
tp = oos_conf_table[2, 2]
tn = oos_conf_table[1, 1]
num_pred_pos = sum(oos_conf_table[, 2])
num_pred_neg = sum(oos_conf_table[, 1])
num_pos = sum(oos_conf_table[2, ])
num_neg = sum(oos_conf_table[1, ])
precision = tp / num_pred_pos
cat("precision", round(precision * 100, 2), "%\n")
recall = tp / num_pos
cat("recall", round(recall * 100, 2), "%\n")
false_discovery_rate = 1 - precision
cat("false_discovery_rate", round(false_discovery_rate * 100, 2), "%\n")
false_omission_rate = fn / num_pred_neg
cat("false_omission_rate", round(false_omission_rate * 100, 2), "%\n")
```

This whole classifier hinged on the decision of 50%! What if we change it??

# Asymmetric Cost Classifiers

Let's establish a *new* rule: if the probability estimate is greater than or equal to 90%, let's classify the observation as positive, otherwise 0.

```{r}
y_hats_train = factor(ifelse(p_hats_train >= 0.9, ">50K", "<=50K"))
mean(y_hats_train != y_train)
oos_conf_table = table(y_train, y_hats_train)
oos_conf_table
```

Of course the misclassification error went up! But now look at the confusion table! The second column represents all $\hat{y} = 1$ and there's not too many of them! Why? You've made it *much* harder to classify something as positive. Here's the new additional performance metrics now:

```{r}
n = sum(oos_conf_table)
fp = oos_conf_table[1, 2]
fn = oos_conf_table[2, 1]
tp = oos_conf_table[2, 2]
tn = oos_conf_table[1, 1]
num_pred_pos = sum(oos_conf_table[, 2])
num_pred_neg = sum(oos_conf_table[, 1])
num_pos = sum(oos_conf_table[2, ])
num_neg = sum(oos_conf_table[1, ])
precision = tp / num_pred_pos
cat("precision", round(precision * 100, 2), "%\n")
recall = tp / num_pos
cat("recall", round(recall * 100, 2), "%\n")
false_discovery_rate = 1 - precision
cat("false_discovery_rate", round(false_discovery_rate * 100, 2), "%\n")
false_omission_rate = fn / num_pred_neg
cat("false_omission_rate", round(false_omission_rate * 100, 2), "%\n")
```

We don't make many false discoveries but we make a lot of false omissions! It's a tradeoff...

# Receiver-Operator Curve Plot

The entire classifier is indexed by that indicator function probability threshold which creates the classification decision. Why not see look at the entire range of possible classification models. We do this with a function. We will go through it slowly and explain each piece:

```{r}
#' Computes performance metrics for a binary probabilistic classifer
#'
#' Each row of the result will represent one of the many models and its elements record the performance of that model so we can (1) pick a "best" model at the end and (2) overall understand the performance of the probability estimates a la the Brier scores, etc.
#'
#' @param p_hats  The probability estimates for n predictions
#' @param y_true  The true observed responses
#' @param res     The resolution to use for the grid of threshold values (defaults to 1e-3)
#'
#' @return        The matrix of all performance results
compute_metrics_prob_classifier = function(p_hats, y_true, res = 0.001){
  #we first make the grid of all prob thresholds
  p_thresholds = seq(0 + res, 1 - res, by = res) #values of 0 or 1 are trivial
  
  #now we create a matrix which will house all of our results
  performance_metrics = matrix(NA, nrow = length(p_thresholds), ncol = 12)
  colnames(performance_metrics) = c(
    "p_th",
    "TN",
    "FP",
    "FN",
    "TP",
    "miscl_err",
    "precision",
    "recall",
    "FDR",
    "FPR",
    "FOR",
    "miss_rate"
  )
  
  #now we iterate through each p_th and calculate all metrics about the classifier and save
  n = length(y_true)
  for (i in 1 : length(p_thresholds)){
    p_th = p_thresholds[i]
    y_hats = factor(ifelse(p_hats >= p_th, ">50K", "<=50K"))
    confusion_table = table(
      factor(y_true, levels = c("<=50K", ">50K")),
      factor(y_hats, levels = c("<=50K", ">50K"))
    )
      
    fp = confusion_table[1, 2]
    fn = confusion_table[2, 1]
    tp = confusion_table[2, 2]
    tn = confusion_table[1, 1]
    npp = sum(confusion_table[, 2])
    npn = sum(confusion_table[, 1])
    np = sum(confusion_table[2, ])
    nn = sum(confusion_table[1, ])
  
    performance_metrics[i, ] = c(
      p_th,
      tn,
      fp,
      fn,
      tp,
      (fp + fn) / n,
      tp / npp, #precision
      tp / np,  #recall
      fp / npp, #false discovery rate (FDR)
      fp / nn,  #false positive rate (FPR)
      fn / npn, #false omission rate (FOR)
      fn / np   #miss rate
    )
  }
  
  #finally return the matrix
  performance_metrics
}
```

Now let's generate performance results for the in-sample data:

```{r}
performance_metrics_in_sample = compute_metrics_prob_classifier(p_hats_train, y_train)

round(head(performance_metrics_in_sample), 3)
round(tail(performance_metrics_in_sample), 3)
```

Now let's plot the ROC curve

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(performance_metrics_in_sample)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = FPR, y = recall)) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") + 
  coord_fixed() + xlim(0, 1) + ylim(0, 1)
```

Now calculate the area under the curve (AUC) which is used to evaluate the probabilistic classifier (just like the Brier score) using a trapezoid area function. 

```{r}
pacman::p_load(pracma)
-trapz(performance_metrics_in_sample[, "FPR"], performance_metrics_in_sample[, "recall"])
```

This is not bad at all!

Note that I should add $<0, 0>$ and $<1, 1>$ as points before this is done but I didn't...

How do we do out of sample?


```{r}
performance_metrics_oos = compute_metrics_prob_classifier(p_hats_test, y_test)
```

And graph the ROC:


```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(performance_metrics_in_sample)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = FPR, y = recall)) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") + 
  coord_fixed() + xlim(0, 1) + ylim(0, 1) +
  geom_line(data = data.frame(performance_metrics_oos), aes(x = FPR, y = recall), col = "blue")
```


```{r}
-trapz(performance_metrics_oos[, "FPR"], performance_metrics_oos[, "recall"])
```


Not bad at all - only a tad worse! In the real world it's usually a lot worse. We are lucky we have 5,000 train and test.

# Detection Error Tradeoff curve

```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(performance_metrics_in_sample)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = FDR, y = miss_rate)) +
  coord_fixed() + xlim(0, 1) + ylim(0, 1) +
  geom_line(data = data.frame(performance_metrics_oos), aes(x = FDR, y = miss_rate), col = "blue")
```


#Using AUC to Compare Probabilistic Classification Models

What would the effect be of less information on the same traing set size? Imagine we didn't know the features: occupation, education, education_num, relationship, marital_status. How would we do relative to the above? Worse!

```{r}
logistic_mod_less_data = glm(income ~ . - occupation - education - education_num - relationship - marital_status, adult_train, family = "binomial")
p_hats_test = predict(logistic_mod_less_data, adult_test, type = "response")
performance_metrics_oos_mod_2 = compute_metrics_prob_classifier(p_hats_test, y_test)
ggplot(data.frame(performance_metrics_oos)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = FPR, y = recall), col = "blue") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") + 
  coord_fixed() + xlim(0, 1) + ylim(0, 1) +
  geom_line(data = data.frame(performance_metrics_oos_mod_2), aes(x = FPR, y = recall), col = "green")
```

and we can see clearly that the AUC is worse:

```{r}
-trapz(performance_metrics_oos_mod_2[, "FPR"], performance_metrics_oos_mod_2[, "recall"])
```

As we lose information that is related to the true causal inputs, we lose predictive ability. Same story for the entire class since error due to ignorance increases! And certainly no different in probabilistic classifiers.

# Choosing a Decision Threshold Based on Asymmetric Costs and Rewards

The ROC and DET curves gave you a glimpse into all the possibilities. Each point on that curve is a separate $g(x)$ with its own performance metrics. How do you pick one?

Let's create rewards and costs. Imagine we are trying to predict income because we want to sell people an expensive item e.g. a car. We want to advertise our cars via a nice packet in the mail. The packet costs \$5. If we send a packet to someone who really does make $>50K$/yr then we are expected to make \$1000. So we have rewards and costs below:

```{r}
r_tp = 1000 - 5
c_fp = -5
c_fn = -1000
r_tn = 0
```

Let's return to the linear logistic model with all features. Let's calculate the overall oos average reward per observation (per person) for each possible $p_{th}$:

```{r}
n = nrow(adult_test)
performance_metrics_oos = data.frame(performance_metrics_oos)
performance_metrics_oos$avg_reward = 
  (r_tp * performance_metrics_oos$TP +
  c_fp * performance_metrics_oos$FP +
  c_fn * performance_metrics_oos$FN +
  r_tn * performance_metrics_oos$TN) / n
```

Let's plot average reward (reward per person) by threshold:

```{r}
ggplot(performance_metrics_oos) +
  geom_line(aes(x = p_th, y = avg_reward)) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, col = "red")
```

Obviously, the best decision is $p_{th} = 0$ which means you classifiy everything as a positive. This makes sense because the mailing is so cheap. The more interesting problem is where the cost of advertising is higher:

```{r}
r_tp = 1000 - 200
c_fp = -200
c_fn = -1000
r_tn = 0
performance_metrics_oos = data.frame(performance_metrics_oos)
performance_metrics_oos$avg_reward = 
  (r_tp * performance_metrics_oos$TP +
  c_fp * performance_metrics_oos$FP +
  c_fn * performance_metrics_oos$FN +
  r_tn * performance_metrics_oos$TN) / n
ggplot(performance_metrics_oos) +
  geom_line(aes(x = p_th, y = avg_reward)) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, col = "red")
```

What are the performance characteristics of the optimal model?

```{r}
i_star = which.max(performance_metrics_oos$avg_reward)
round(as.matrix(performance_metrics_oos[i_star, ]), 2)
```

If $g_{pr}$ is closer to $f_{pr}$, what happens? All the threshold-derived classification models get better and you are guaranteed to make more money since you have a better discriminating eye.

# Bias-Variance Decomposition of Mean Squared Error

Let's try to fit a quadratic $f$ with a linear model and examine bias-variance tradeoff.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
xmin = 0
xmax = 5
n_train = 20
n_test = 1000
sigsq = 1
resolution = 10000

Nsim = 1000

training_gs = matrix(NA, nrow = Nsim, ncol = 2)
all_residuals = matrix(NA, nrow = Nsim, ncol = n_test)

for (nsim in 1 : Nsim){
  #simulate dataset $\mathbb{D}$
  x_train = runif(n_train, xmin, xmax)
  delta_train = rnorm(n_train, 0, sqrt(sigsq)) #mean zero, variance sigsq always (not dependent on value of x)
  y_train = x_train^2 + delta_train
  
  #fit a model g | x's, delta's and save it
  g_model = lm(y_train ~ ., data.frame(x = x_train))
  training_gs[nsim, ] = coef(g_model)
  
  #generate oos dataset and save residuals on oos data
  x_test = runif(n_test, xmin, xmax)
  delta_test = rnorm(n_test, 0, sigsq) #mean zero, variance sigsq always (not dependent on value of x)
  y_test = x_test^2 + delta_test
  y_hat_test = predict(g_model, data.frame(x = x_test))
  all_residuals[nsim, ] = y_test - y_hat_test
}
```

Graph the last one:

```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(x = x_train, y = y_train)) + geom_point(aes(x, y))
```


Take a look at the mse:

```{r}
mse = mean(c(all_residuals)^2)
mse
```

This should be irreducible error plus bias-squared plus variance.

Let's visualize the bias

```{r}
g_average = colMeans(training_gs)
f = function(x){x^2}
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)
ggplot(data.frame(x = x, f = f(x)), aes(x, f)) + 
  geom_line(col = "darkgreen") + 
  geom_abline(intercept = g_average[1], slope = g_average[2], col = "red")
```

What is the average bias of $g$?

```{r}
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)
g_avg_x = g_average[1] + g_average[2] * x
f_x = x^2
biases = f_x - g_avg_x
expe_bias_g_sq = mean(biases^2)
expe_bias_g_sq
```

What is the variance? Let's look at all lines:

```{r}
plot_obj = ggplot() + 
  xlim(xmin, xmax) + ylim(xmin^2, xmax^2)

for (nsim in 1 : min(Nsim, 100)){ #otherwise takes too long
  plot_obj = plot_obj + geom_abline(intercept = training_gs[nsim, 1], slope = training_gs[nsim, 2], col = "blue")
}

plot_obj +
  geom_abline(intercept = g_average[1], slope = g_average[2], col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

Now calculate this average variance:

```{r}
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)

expe_g_x = g_average[1] + g_average[2] * x

var_x_s = array(NA, Nsim)
for (nsim in 1 : Nsim){
  g_x = training_gs[nsim, 1] + training_gs[nsim, 2] * x
  var_x_s[nsim] = mean((g_x - expe_g_x)^2)
}

expe_var_g = mean(var_x_s)
expe_var_g
```

Now check the equivalence

```{r}
mse
sigsq
expe_bias_g_sq
expe_var_g
sigsq + expe_bias_g_sq + expe_var_g
```

This is not exactly equal due to numerical error.

Let's try the whole thing again using a quadratic regression!

```{r}
training_gs = matrix(NA, nrow = Nsim, ncol = 3)
all_residuals = matrix(NA, nrow = Nsim, ncol = n_test)

for (nsim in 1 : Nsim){
  #simulate dataset $\mathbb{D}$
  x_train = runif(n_train, xmin, xmax)
  delta_train = rnorm(n_train, 0, sqrt(sigsq)) #mean zero, variance sigsq always (not dependent on value of x)
  y_train = x_train^2 + delta_train
  
  #fit a model g | x's, delta's and save it
  g_model = lm(y_train ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE), data.frame(x = x_train))
  training_gs[nsim, ] = coef(g_model)
  
  #generate oos dataset and save residuals on oos data
  x_test = runif(n_test, xmin, xmax)
  delta_test = rnorm(n_test, 0, sigsq) #mean zero, variance sigsq always (not dependent on value of x)
  y_test = x_test^2 + delta_test
  y_hat_test = predict(g_model, data.frame(x = x_test))
  all_residuals[nsim, ] = y_test - y_hat_test
}
```

Take a look at the mse:

```{r}
mse = mean(c(all_residuals)^2)
mse
```

Much lower! Why? Bias went down. 

Let's visualize the bias

```{r}
g_average = colMeans(training_gs)
f = function(x){x^2}
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)
ggplot(data.frame(x = x, f = f(x)), aes(x, f)) + 
  geom_line(col = "darkgreen") + 
  stat_function(fun = function(x){g_average[1] + g_average[2] * x + g_average[3] * x^2}, col = "red")
```

Not much! What is the average bias of $g$?

```{r}
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)
g_avg_x = g_average[1] + g_average[2] * x + g_average[3] * x^2
f_x = x^2
biases = f_x - g_avg_x
expe_bias_g_sq = mean(biases^2)
expe_bias_g_sq
```

What is the variance? Let's look at all lines:

```{r}
plot_obj = ggplot(data.frame(x = x)) + 
  xlim(xmin, xmax) + ylim(xmin^2, xmax^2)

for (nsim in 1 : min(Nsim, 50)){ #otherwise takes too long
  plot_obj = plot_obj + geom_line(data = data.frame(x = x, y = training_gs[nsim, 1] + training_gs[nsim, 2] * x + training_gs[nsim, 3] * x^2), mapping = aes(x, y), col = "blue")
}

plot_obj +
  stat_function(fun = function(x){g_average[1] + g_average[2] * x + g_average[3] * x^2}, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

Now calculate this average variance:

```{r}
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)

expe_g_x = g_average[1] + g_average[2] * x + g_average[3] * x^2

var_x_s = array(NA, Nsim)
for (nsim in 1 : Nsim){
  g_x = training_gs[nsim, 1] + training_gs[nsim, 2] * x + training_gs[nsim, 3] * x^2
  var_x_s[nsim] = mean((g_x - expe_g_x)^2)
}

expe_var_g = mean(var_x_s)
expe_var_g
```

Now check the equivalence

```{r}
mse
sigsq
expe_bias_g_sq
expe_var_g
sigsq + expe_bias_g_sq + expe_var_g
```


Try it again with quintic polynomials!

```{r}
training_gs = matrix(NA, nrow = Nsim, ncol = 6)
all_residuals = matrix(NA, nrow = Nsim, ncol = n_test)

for (nsim in 1 : Nsim){
  #simulate dataset $\mathbb{D}$
  x_train = runif(n_train, xmin, xmax)
  delta_train = rnorm(n_train, 0, sqrt(sigsq)) #mean zero, variance sigsq always (not dependent on value of x)
  y_train = x_train^2 + delta_train
  
  #fit a model g | x's, delta's and save it
  g_model = lm(y_train ~ poly(x, 5, raw = TRUE), data.frame(x = x_train))
  training_gs[nsim, ] = coef(g_model)
  
  #generate oos dataset and save residuals on oos data
  x_test = runif(n_test, xmin, xmax)
  delta_test = rnorm(n_test, 0, sigsq) #mean zero, variance sigsq always (not dependent on value of x)
  y_test = x_test^2 + delta_test
  y_hat_test = predict(g_model, data.frame(x = x_test))
  all_residuals[nsim, ] = y_test - y_hat_test
}
```

Take a look at the mse:

```{r}
mse = mean(c(all_residuals)^2)
mse
```

Much higher! Why? Variance went up!

Let's visualize the bias

```{r}
g_average = colMeans(training_gs)
f = function(x){x^2}
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)
ggplot(data.frame(x = x, f = f(x)), aes(x, f)) + 
  geom_line(col = "darkgreen") + 
  stat_function(fun = function(x){g_average[1] + g_average[2] * x + g_average[3] * x^2 + g_average[4] * x^3 + g_average[5] * x^4 + g_average[6] * x^5}, col = "red")
```

Not much! Now acutllay compute the average bias squared of $g$:

```{r}
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)
g_avg_x = g_average[1] + g_average[2] * x + g_average[3] * x^2 + g_average[4] * x^3 + g_average[5] * x^4 + g_average[6] * x^5
f_x = x^2
biases = f_x - g_avg_x
expe_bias_g_sq = mean(biases^2)
expe_bias_g_sq
```

This appears to have increased over last time ... but it's only because we're not running the regression infinite times. Remember this "expectation" is only an average.

What is the variance? Let's look at all lines:

```{r}
plot_obj = ggplot(data.frame(x = x)) + 
  xlim(xmin, xmax) + ylim(xmin^2, xmax^2)

for (nsim in 1 : min(Nsim, 50)){ #otherwise takes too long
  plot_obj = plot_obj + geom_line(data = data.frame(x = x, y = training_gs[nsim, 1] + training_gs[nsim, 2] * x + training_gs[nsim, 3] * x^2 + training_gs[nsim, 4] * x^3 + training_gs[nsim, 5] * x^4 + training_gs[nsim, 6] * x^5), mapping = aes(x, y), col = "blue")
}

plot_obj +
  stat_function(fun = function(x){g_average[1] + g_average[2] * x + g_average[3] * x^2 + g_average[4] * x^3 + g_average[5] * x^4 + g_average[6] * x^5}, col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

It looks awful!!!

Now actually compute the average variance numerically:

```{r}
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)

expe_g_x = g_average[1] + g_average[2] * x + g_average[3] * x^2 + g_average[4] * x^3 + g_average[5] * x^4 + g_average[6] * x^5

var_x_s = array(NA, Nsim)
for (nsim in 1 : Nsim){
  g_x = training_gs[nsim, 1] + training_gs[nsim, 2] * x + training_gs[nsim, 3] * x^2 + training_gs[nsim, 4] * x^3 + training_gs[nsim, 5] * x^4 + training_gs[nsim, 6] * x^5
  var_x_s[nsim] = mean((g_x - expe_g_x)^2)
}

expe_var_g = mean(var_x_s)
expe_var_g
```

Any more complexity than you need allows for overfitting!

Now check the equivalence

```{r}
mse
sigsq

# Bias - Variance Decomposition of MSE in Regression Trees

Let's return to the simulated sine curve data which we used to introduce regression trees.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
n_train = 100
n_test = 500
xmin = 0
xmax = 10
sigsq = 0.09
Nsim = 100
resolution = 1000
```

And load the tree package:

```{r}
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx4000m")
# pacman::p_install_gh("kapelner/YARF", subdir = "YARF", ref = "dev")
pacman::p_load(YARF)
```

Now let's generate lots of different datasets and fit many tree models:

```{r}
training_gs = list() #storing entire objects - need a hash
all_residuals = matrix(NA, nrow = Nsim, ncol = n_test)

for (nsim in 1 : Nsim){
  #simulate dataset $\mathbb{D}$
  x_train = runif(n_train, xmin, xmax)
  delta_train = rnorm(n_train, 0, sqrt(sigsq))
  y_train = sin(x_train) + delta_train
  # ggplot(data.frame(x = x, y = y), aes(x, y)) + geom_point(lwd=0.6) 
  
  #fit a model g | x's, delta's and save it
  g_model = YARFCART(data.frame(x = x_train), y_train)
  training_gs[[nsim]] = g_model
  
  #generate oos dataset and save residuals on oos data
  x_test = runif(n_test, xmin, xmax)
  delta_test = rnorm(n_test, 0, sqrt(sigsq)) #mean zero, variance sigsq always (not dependent on value of x)
  y_test = sin(x_test) + delta_test
  y_hat_test = predict(g_model, data.frame(x = x_test))
  all_residuals[nsim, ] = y_test - y_hat_test
}
```

Let's look at the last data set to remind ourselves of the problem setting:

```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(x = x_train, y = y_train)) + geom_point(aes(x, y))
```


What does the storage of all the models look like?

```{r}
head(training_gs)
```

Take a look at the mse:

```{r}
mse = mean(c(all_residuals)^2)
mse
```

Let's visualize the bias

```{r}
#generate x and the truth
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)
f_x = sin(x)

#now estimate the expectation of g by averaging all the different models
g_avg_x = array(0, resolution)
for (nsim in 1 : Nsim){
  g_nsim = training_gs[[nsim]]
  g_avg_x = g_avg_x + predict(g_nsim, data.frame(x = x))
}
g_avg_x = g_avg_x / Nsim #average of all models

#now plot
ggplot(data.frame(x = x, f = f_x, expe_g = g_avg_x)) + 
  geom_line(aes(x, f), col = "darkgreen") + 
  geom_line(aes(x, expe_g), col = "red")
```

Not much! Now actually compute the average bias squared of $g$:

```{r}
biases = f_x - g_avg_x
expe_bias_g_sq = mean(biases^2)
expe_bias_g_sq
```

This is small - why??

It's because trees are so expressive and have such model complexity that they can nail almost any true $f$ function!

That means the MSE save the irreducible noise is coming from the variance. Let's look at all lines:

```{r}
plot_obj = ggplot(data.frame(x = x)) + 
  xlim(xmin, xmax) #+ ylim(xmin^2, xmax^2)

for (nsim in 1 : min(Nsim, 50)){ #otherwise takes too long
  g_nsim = training_gs[[nsim]]
  g_x = predict(g_nsim, data.frame(x = x))
  plot_obj = plot_obj + geom_line(data = data.frame(x = x, y = g_x), aes(x = x, y = y), col = "blue")
}

plot_obj +
  geom_line(data = data.frame(x = x, expe_g = g_avg_x), mapping = aes(x, expe_g), col = "red", lwd = 1.5)
```

It looks awful!!!

Now actually compute the average variance numerically:

```{r}
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)

var_x_s = array(NA, min(Nsim, 50))
for (nsim in 1 : min(Nsim, 50)){ #otherwise takes too long
  g_nsim = training_gs[[nsim]]
  g_x = predict(g_nsim, data.frame(x = x))
  var_x_s[nsim] = mean((g_x - g_avg_x)^2)
}

expe_var_g = mean(var_x_s)
expe_var_g
```

Any more complexity than you need allows for overfitting!

Now check the equivalence

```{r}
mse
sigsq
expe_bias_g_sq
expe_var_g
sigsq + expe_bias_g_sq + expe_var_g
```

# Model Averaging via Bootstrap Aggregation ("Bagging")

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
n_train = 100
n_test = 500
xmin = 0
xmax = 10
sigsq = 0.09
B = 250
resolution = 1000
```

And load the tree package:

```{r}
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx4000m")
# pacman::p_install_gh("kapelner/YARF", subdir = "YARF", ref = "dev")
pacman::p_load(YARF)
```

Now let's generate one dataset (only ONE) 

```{r}
x_train = runif(n_train, xmin, xmax)
delta_train = rnorm(n_train, 0, sqrt(sigsq))
y_train = sin(x_train) + delta_train
ggplot(data.frame(x = x_train, y = y_train)) + geom_point(aes(x, y))
```

Spend a moment to appreciate that this is all we're going to have. There is a lot of irreducible noise that is going to prevent us from finding the sine curve.

Now we create many bootstrap samples to create similiar but different datasets and fit many tree models:

```{r}
bootstrapped_gs = list() #storing entire objects - need a hash

for (b in 1 : B){
  #fit a model g | x's, delta's and save it
  bootstrap_indices_b = sample(1 : n_train, replace = TRUE)
  g_model = YARFCART(data.frame(x = x_train[bootstrap_indices_b]), y_train[bootstrap_indices_b])
  bootstrapped_gs[[b]] = g_model
}
```

Now let's aggregate all models constructed with bootstrap samples together by averaging and see what it looks like relative to real $f$:

```{r}
#generate x and the truth
x = seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = resolution)
f_x = sin(x)

#create the bagged model predictions
g_bagged = array(0, resolution)
for (b in 1 : B){
  g_b = bootstrapped_gs[[b]]
  g_bagged = g_bagged + predict(g_b, data.frame(x = x))
}
g_bagged = g_bagged / B #average of all models

#now plot
ggplot(data.frame(x = x, f = f_x, g_bagged = g_bagged)) + 
  geom_line(aes(x, f), col = "darkgreen") + 
  geom_line(aes(x, g_bagged), col = "red")
```
  
That's pretty good considering the plot of the raw data from above.





Let's look at the bias-variance decomposition
```{r} 
#generate oos dataset and save residuals on oos data
x_test = runif(n_test, xmin, xmax)
delta_test = rnorm(n_test, 0, sqrt(sigsq)) #mean zero, variance sigsq always (not dependent on value of x)
y_test = sin(x_test) + delta_test

y_hat_test = array(0, resolution)
for (b in 1 : B){
  g_b = bootstrapped_gs[[b]]
  y_hat_test = y_hat_test + predict(g_b, data.frame(x = x))
}
y_hat_test = y_hat_test / B #average of all models

all_residuals = y_test - y_hat_test
mse = mean(all_residuals^2)
mse
```

Compute the average bias squared of $g$:

```{r}
biases = f_x - g_bagged
expe_bias_g_sq = mean(biases^2)
expe_bias_g_sq
```
